# Store-Visits-Forecasting

## Business Understanding
My findings will encompass what may be contributing to the fluctuation of the foot traffic rates of restaurants/stores across Japan. This information will benefit corporate management levels within the F&B industry in optimizing category management, store selection, and associated resource allocation, leading to higher store visits, higher revenue, and a potential better reputation resulting from better customer service. The factors explored will also show a better picture of the Japanese market in terms of customer's tastes in consideration of other local factors like holidays, weather, and seasonality.

## Data Understanding
We have three main data sets as below. As the raw data was very heavy and complicated, these three datasets were already the result of a pre-processing process.
-	Store visits data of 2016 (train_restaurant_visitors.csv): provides such data as date of visits, type of restaurant/store, latitude and longitude of the store, and the number of visitors to each store by date.
-	Holiday information in Japan (holidays_data.csv): provides different holiday names in Japan by date.
-	Weather data in 2016 (new_weather_data2.csv): provides a wide variety of weather attributes in each day, in terms of key categories: temperature, humidity, rain, sunshine, snow, and wind.
